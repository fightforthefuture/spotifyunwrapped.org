# spotifyunwrapped.org

This is a quick Spotify Wrapped parody site to amplify the [Justice At Spotify](https://www.unionofmusicians.org/justice-at-spotify) campaign by [UMAW](https://www.unionofmusicians.org/).

Our numbers are estimates, but should be in the ballpark of reality. You can see how we get them in [app.js](https://github.com/fightforthefuture/spotifyunwrapped.org/blob/master/js/app.js#L98).

Spotify earnings numbers come from [them](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2020-10-29/spotify-reports-third-quarter-2020-earnings/). We made a completely uneducated guess about Q4.

We're using Spotify's [Top Artists and Tracks API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/personalization/get-users-top-artists-and-tracks/) for data. That gives us the past 6 months instead of the full year, so your Unwrapped results may look a little different than Wrapped.
